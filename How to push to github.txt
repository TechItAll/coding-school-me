1ST STEP:
check if any changes have been made (red=subtractions, green=additions) with
git status

2ND STEP:
add any changes (subtractions and additions) with
git add (name of files)

example ->
git add test.py awesome.py cool.txt
or
git add .
^^ above just adds all changes without you having to type every file manually

3RD STEP:
commit all the things you added in the previous step with a message
git commit -m "your message goes here"

4TH STEP:
push changes to github with
git push
