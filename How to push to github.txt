1ST STEP:
check if any changes have been made (red=subtractions, green=additions) with
git status

2ND STEP:
add any changes (subtractions and additions) with
git add (name of files)

example ->
git add test.py awesome.py cool.txt
or
git add .
^^ above just adds all changes without you having to type every file manually

3RD STEP:
commit all the things you added in the previous step with a message
git commit -m "your message goes here"

4TH STEP:
push changes to github with
git push

----------------------------------------------
HOW TO SET UP NEW REPO:

create new repo on github.com
click the green "Code" button and copy the HTTPS link
open a new empty folder for your code on your PC

open the terminal and type
git clone {paste the link that you copied here}

------------------------------------------
BRANCHES AND MERGES

create a new branch on github.com

open your terminal in your folder and do
git fetch 
- refreshes/updates all stuff

switch to the branch you made
git checkout {name of the branch}

now you can do all your additions, commits, and pushes on the branch

when you want to merge, go to github.com and click the button that says something
about changes have been made on that branch and create a pull request

hopefully there are no conflicts, so you can just keep going with clicking the green buttons

then switch to main "git checkout main"
then git pull
